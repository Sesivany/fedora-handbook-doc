== How to Get Fedora?
=== Try and Install

It is possible to install Fedora from optical media (CD, DVD), a USB flash drive, or over the network. This is accomplished by accessing an installation image. Installation images of _Fedora{nbsp}Workstation_ are available for download in ISO format at link:http://getfedora.org[getfedora.org]. _Fedora Workstation_ defaults to a 64bit operating system download as that is what is best for most users.

If you aren't ready to install yet and want to try it first, there is a way to do so without losing or changing anything already on your PC. This is done by using a live image which allows you to boot to a fully fuctional system and find out what Fedora is like, experiment, and determine whether it fully supports your PC's hardware.

To run _Fedora Workstation_ reasonably it is recommend that you have at least a 1GHz processor, 2 GiB of memory, 10 GiB of hard drive space, and a graphics card that supports hardware acceleration. These aren't the minimum requirements, but they are the best for most users. Some users may wish to run Fedora on lower powered machines and will find it performs well there too.

==== Creating Install Media

If you're going need to create installaiton media, the following options may be helpful:

* _USB Installation_ - To create a USB installation drive, you can use the _Fedora LiveUSB Creator_. It can run on _MS Windows_ or Linux. Beware, this program will erase all the data on the flash drive! _Fedora LiveUSB Creator_ can download the installation image for you when you run it. You can get this app at link:https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator].
+
_GNOME and Disks_ - If you already use a Linux operating system (with the GNOME desktop environment), you can use built-in software to write a USB drive. In the _Files_ app, you can right-click an ISO image, choose "`Open in a different app`" and then choose "`Write on disk`". This will open the _Disks_ utility which will write the image on to a flash drive.
+
If you decide to write the install image on to a USB flash drive, you should carefully double-check that you've picked the correct target drive. If you're doing this on _MS Windows_, you need to pick the character that has been assigned to the drive you'd like to use (typically this will be `D:` or `E:`). On Linux, you need to do the same using the device(typically this is will be `/dev/sdX` where `X` is a character). The easiest and safest way to find do this is on Linux is to use the _Disks_ utility mentioned above.

* _DVD Installation_ - A _DVD_ is a very traditional way of installing Fedora. You can create an installation DVD by writing an ISO image to a DVD. Most modern operating systems can do this operation with built-in software. If not, you can install a specialized application such as _Brasero_ on Linux and _ImgBurn_ on _MS Windows_. All versions of _OS{nbsp}X_ can write DVDs using _Finder_ and _Disk Utility_.

=== Installing Fedora

1. _Booting_ -- no matter what media you've chosen, you'll need to make sure that you set the right boot sequence in the BIOS of the computer you'd like to install Fedora on. The drive with the install media needs to be in the first position. You can get to the BIOS configuration by pressing a specific key after starting the computer. The key depends on the vendor (typically the keys are kbd:[Delete], kbd:[F1], or {nbsp}kbd:[F2]). Alternately, many vendors allow you to choose a boot drive without having to go to the BIOS settings by pressing the kbd:[F12] key.

2. _Initial Screen_ -- after successful booting you'll see the initial screen where you can choose between installing Fedora (or booting into the live system) and verifying the install media. If you choose installation, you'll boot into the live system and will be asked if you want to try the system out or install it on the hard drive. If you choose to "Try Fedora" you can use it in this wya for as long as you want and can choose to perform an installation at any time by clicking on the installer icon in the menu.

3. _Trying the System_ -- if you've chosen to try the system, you'll begin using the _GNOME Shell_. The top of the display contains the most commonly used control elements. There is an _Activities_ button in the upper left corner which will get you to applications (and to the option to install Fedora on your system). The upper right corner has controls that allow you to set up the network, restart or shutdown the system.

4. _Installer_ -- once you decide to install Fedora, you'll being using the helpful installation system, Anaconda. The insaller consists of different spokes that manage the options for areas such as language settings, time zone, etc. The disk partitioning spoke is the most important part of the intaller. This spoke will define where on your hard drive Fedora will be installed. The installer offers you automatic partitioning which will configure the hard drive in a way that is useful for most people. You can also choose manual partitioning and apply a customized setting. It's also possible to set up encryption for better security.
+
Fedora also allows you to create a dualboot system. This is a PC that has two operating systems installed at the same time. It's easy to install Fedora next to an existing _MS Windows_ installation.
+
In the partitioning dialog, you will see the existing partitions on the left. Before you confirm the changes make sure that everything is the way you meant it to be (for example that all partitions of other operating systems are still there, if you wish to keep them). When you confirm the changes and start the installation, the changes will be final.

5. _End_ -- while the system is being installed, you need to provide several important pieces of information, such as the root or administrator password, and the information for creating a user account. You will use normally use the user account you created and only use the root password when you need to make a system-wide change. Fedora has the classic approach to user accounts where the root account is not disabled. So you'll need to set up and remember at least two passwords. Alternately, you can check _Admin_ option when creating your user account. This enables the account to act as an administrator in vast majority of operations and avoids your having to use the root password often.

And that's it. The whole installation should take less than than several dozen minutes. After restart you'll just need to perform a couple of short post-install tasks such as changing the boot order to the original state and then you're ready to go. Everything worked well? Now you can begin exploring Fedora!
